<h1> This Neat picture </h1>

    <img src="images/home.png" alt="ATM8 Superflat Episode 3: one of two images can display, changing when the user clicks on the image. the first picture is an image of a Minecraft character standing in a village. the other picture is of a minecraft character standing in the twilight forest which is a realm added into the game of minecraft by a mod" />

<h2> Whats this picture all about? </h2>

<p> I am currently playing all the mods 8 on a superflat world gen which is going to create unique challenges which I am going to have to use creative problem solving to overcome. This is going to make the gameplay far more interesting than a regular playthrough which does not use an extra level of difficulty for gameplay. This is going to attract a wider audience than the normal playthrough does because...

<ul>
	<li>people are more interested in solving increasingly complex problems rather than re-doing tried and true 	methods to complete the questline of the modpack</li>
	<li>people like to watch others solve complex problems</li>
	<li>superflat world generation is weird and fun</li>
</ul>
